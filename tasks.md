1. place directory under version control with git
 * git init
 * git add
 * git commit
2. hello.cpp

 * (optional) restore original working version using git restore
3. basic_types.cpp
 * check results of original code
 * what do you expect for a, b and c?
 * how are true and false values printed?
 * define an int variable similar to dutch. What value does it have?
 * define a float variable similar to dutch, using (1.f/7.f).

   other?
 * (optional) add and commit the changes to basic_types.cpp to your git
   repository.
4. expressions.cpp
